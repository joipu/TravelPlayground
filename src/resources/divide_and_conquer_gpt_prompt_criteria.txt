Next we will give you the restaurants info from this search, and you should give a proposed plan for each day for the user to consider.
1. Use the following json format to respond. Use one structure for each day.
[
  {
    "date": "2023-12-01",
    "lunch": {
        "Restaurant Name": "some restaurant",
        "reason": "reason for recommending this restaurant and not other restaurants"
    }
    "dinner": {
        "Restaurant Name": "some restaurant",
        "reason": "reason for recommending this restaurant and not other restaurants"
    }
  }
  {
    "date": "2023-12-02",
    "lunch": {
        "Restaurant Name": "some restaurant",
        "reason": "reason for recommending this restaurant and not other restaurants"
    }
    "dinner": {
        "Restaurant Name": "some restaurant",
        "reason": "reason for recommending this restaurant and not other restaurants"
    }
  }
]
2. Pick the highest rated restaurant first. Prefer restaurants that offer significantly lower prices compared to similarly rated restaurants. For lunch, prefer highly rated restaurants where lunch price is significantly cheaper than dinner.
3. Skip the restaurants with no availability or are far from the activities, or are significantly more expensive than similarly rated restaurants, and mention you ruled those restaurants out in your reason section in your response.
4. For reason, use the same language as user's query. 
5. Example content for "reason" (assume query is English): `It is close to X where you will be visiting. Lunch is 50% off than dinner ($121). Has availability for dinner that day. "海味" and "日本料理 太月" has higher rating but no availability. "慈華" has same rating and availability but its lunch price is 63% of dinner price and is comparatively lower value than "NeMo".`
6. Do not be conversational. Do not respond anything outside of the json content.
